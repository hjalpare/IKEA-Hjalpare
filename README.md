## Introduction

Are your instructions for your new IKEA desk lacking in detail? Have you failed, time and time again, to attach the legs of your chairs the right way? Are you concerned about the large excess of screws you have once completing your new bed frame? IKEA hjälpare is here to be your helper!
With IKEA hjälpare, you can:
- View your furniture item as detailed in IKEA stores
- Watch a video tutorial for added visuals 
- Participate in a discussion board with fellow builders to ask any unanswered questions

## Requirements

### Scenario
As an IKEA customer, I want access to more detailed instructions so that I can build my furniture relatively stress free and quickly. 

### Dependencies
Video tutorials are available for public access 
Ikea data is available 

### Assumptions
YouTube videos are public

### Example
1.1 Given a feed of IKEA data is available

When I search for “Alex”

Then I should be directed to a page with a picture of the ALEX drawer and a discussion board for this item.

1.2 Given feeds of IKEA and YouTube data are available
When I search for “Malm”
Then I should be directed to a page with a picture of the MALM bed frame, an embedded YouTube link for the building tutorial, and a discussion board post for this item.

1.3 Given a feed IKEA is available
When I search for “3478410”
Then nothing should be returned in the search results.
